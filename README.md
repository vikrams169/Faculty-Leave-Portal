# Faculty-Leave-Portal
A Faculty Leave Portal designed using MySQL, MongoDB, PHP, & HTML as a part of the course CS301 : Database Management Systems at IIT Ropar
<br><br>
It can be hosted by using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) by placing the directory 'frontend' in the 'htdocs' directory of the XAMPP installation and further loading the database into PhpMyAdmin using the queries in init.sql.
<br><br>
To be able to run Phase 2 (enabling faculty profiles using MongoDB), the following dependencies need to be installed :<br>
1. MongoDB (Community Server Version 4.4.5)
2. PHP-MongoDB Driver (PECL Version 1.9.1 for PHP 8.0.3)
3. Composer (to use the MongoDB-PHP Library)
